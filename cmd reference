3) Build your Docker image using the following command. For information on building a Docker file from scratch see the instructions here. You can skip this step if your image is already built:
docker build -t testing-container-repo .
4) After the build completes, tag your image so you can push the image to this repository:
docker tag flask-docker-image:latest 079385551353.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/testing-container-repo:latest
5) Run the following command to push this image to your newly created AWS repository:
docker push 079385551353.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/testing-container-repo:latest



docker run -d -p 8080:8080 flask-docker-image
